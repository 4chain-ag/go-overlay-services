## Features 

- **Standalone HTTP Server**  
  Operates as a self-contained server with customizable configuration and overlay engine layers.

- **📖 OpenAPI Integration**  
  Supports OpenAPI specifications with an interactive Swagger UI for exploring and testing endpoints.

- **🗂️ Flexible Configuration Formats**  
  Allows importing and exporting configuration using common formats such as `.env`, `.yaml`, and `.json`.

- **📊 Real-Time Observability**  
  Provides basic real-time observability and performance monitoring out of the box.

## Middleware & Built-in Components

- **🔎 Request Tracing**  
  Attaches a unique `request ID` to every incoming request for consistent traceability across logs and systems.

- **🔄 Idempotency Support**  
  Enables safe request retries by ensuring idempotent behavior for designated endpoints.

- **🌐 CORS Handling**  
  Manages cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) to support web applications securely.

- **🚨 Panic Recovery**  
  Catches and logs panics during request handling, with optional stack trace support.

- **📝 Structured Request Logging**  
  Logs HTTP requests using a customizable format, including method, path, status, and errors.

- **❤️ Health Check Endpoint**  
  Exposes an endpoint for health and readiness checks, suitable for orchestration tools.

- **📈 Performance Profiling**  
  Integrates `pprof` profiling tools under the `/api/v1` path for runtime diagnostics.

- **📦 Request Body Limits**  
  Enforces size limits on `application/octet-stream` payloads to protect against abuse.

- **🔐 Bearer Token Authorization**  
  Validates Bearer tokens found in the `Authorization` header of incoming HTTP requests. Also enforces authorization based on OpenAPI security scopes.

## Configuration

The server configuration is encapsulated in the `Config` struct with the following fields:

| Field                   | Type            | Description                                                                                         | Default Value                    |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `AppName`               | `string`        | Name of the application shown in server metadata.                                               | `"Overlay API v0.0.0"`           |
| `Port`                  | `int`           | TCP port number on which the server listens.                                                    | `3000`                          |

A default configuration `DefaultConfig` is provided for local development and testing, with sensible defaults for all fields.

### Server Options

The HTTP server supports flexible setup via functional options (`ServerOption`), allowing customization during server creation:

| Option                             | Description                                                                                      |

| `WithOctetStreamLimit(int64)`    | Sets a custom limit on octet-stream request body sizes to control memory usage.                |
| `WithConfig(Config)`              | Applies a full configuration struct to initialize the Fiber app with specified settings.      |

## Development Task Automation

This project uses a dedicated **Taskfile.yml** powered by the [`task`](https://taskfile.dev/) CLI to automate common workflows. This centralizes critical operations such as testing, code generation, API documentation bundling, and code linting into a single, easy-to-use interface.

Formalizing these processes ensures:

- ✅ **Consistency** across developer environments  
- ⚙️ **Automation** of chained commands and validations  
- ⏱️ **Efficiency** by reducing manual complexity  
- 🔁 **Reproducibility** in CI/CD and local setups  
- 🧹 **Maintainability** with centralized workflow updates  

### Available Tasks

- **`execute-unit-tests`**  
  Runs all unit tests with fail-fast, vet checks, and disables caching for fresh results.

- **`oapi-codegen`**  
  Generates HTTP server code and models from the OpenAPI spec to keep API and code in sync.

- **`swagger-doc-gen`**  
  Bundles the OpenAPI spec into a single YAML file, ready for validation and docs tools.

- **`swagger-ui-up`**  
  Bundles, validates, and starts Swagger UI with Docker Compose for interactive API exploration.

- **`swagger-ui-down`**  
  Stops Swagger UI services and cleans up containers.

- **`swagger-cleanup`**  
  Removes generated Swagger files and stops running Swagger UI containers.

- **`execute-linters`**  
  Runs Go linters and applies automatic fixes to maintain code quality.

### Usage Examples

- Run all unit tests: ```task execute-unit-tests```

### Code Snippet Examples

All the proposed examples are available in the [examples directory](./examples/).
